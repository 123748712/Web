    <h4>BTS- psrmission to dance BTS- psrmission to dance</h4>
    It's the thought of being young
	When your heart's just like a drum
	Beating louder with no way to guard it
	When it all seems like it's wrong
	Just sing along to Elton John
	And to that feeling, we're just getting started
	When the nights get colder
	And the rhythms got you falling behind
	Just dream about that moment
	When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
	Then you say
	I wanna dance, the music's got me going
	Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
	Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
	And roll in like we're dancing fools
  </div>
